End-to-End Data Engineering with Azure: Internet Data Ingestion & Reporting

This project implements a complete data engineering solution on Microsoft Azure, extracting data from the internet and preparing it for reporting with Power BI. The architecture leverages various Azure services, including:

Azure Data Factory (ADF): for orchestrating data pipelines and managing data flows.
Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2: for storing raw and processed data in a scalable and secure manner.
Azure Synapse Analytics: for data warehousing and performing complex transformations.
Power BI: for creating interactive and insightful reports and dashboards.
Project Inspiration:

This project is based on the Udemy course "Real-world project for Data Engineers using Azure Data Factory, SQL, Data Lake, Databricks, HDInsight, CI/CD [DP203]" by Ramesh Retnasamy.

Key Features:

Data Ingestion: Extracts data from diverse internet sources using ADF connectors or custom scripts.
Data Transformation: Cleanses, transforms, and prepares data for analysis in Synapse Analytics.
Data Warehousing: Stores and manages transformed data in a structured format within Synapse.
Reporting & Visualization: Uses Power BI to create dashboards and reports for effective data exploration.
Target Audience:

This project is designed for data engineers and aspiring professionals interested in:

Gaining hands-on experience with Azure data engineering services.
Building end-to-end data pipelines for web data extraction and reporting.
